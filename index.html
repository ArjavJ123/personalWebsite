        <p>Hello There! My name is Arjav Jain. I am a CS undergrad student at BITS Pilani , Pilani Campus.I Have a keen interest in physics and would like to explore the application of computer Science in the field of physics.</p>

        <img src="./personalImage.jpeg ">
        <p>I am a CS undergrad at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus, to graduate in the year 2024. I live in New Delhi, India . I did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj. Since my childhood, I have had an attraction towards science. I chose to pursue computer science because I felt it had applications in almost all the fields of science and would be a great skill in doing work in any field.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I like to read, play chess, listen to music. I usually read non fiction or science fiction, as these in my opinion help the brain to think differently or at a better scale. I love solving puzzles , this is why I like to do competitive coding in my free time as it is majorly solving puzzles by applying your brain. My favourite coding language is python as it has high application is maths and physics. </p>
        <p>Currently, I am working to increase my knowledge and skill set as much as possible so that it will benefit me in the future. This is why I have joined multiple clubs in my college like astro club and radio astronomy club, where I am given tasks which improve my skillset while I can do contributions in the field of science</p>
